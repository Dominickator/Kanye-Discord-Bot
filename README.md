# Kanye Bot
A discord bot that when it sees the "!kanye" message, sends a message containing a random quote from Kanye West.\

## How to Build
First off, make sure that you have rust installed and updated \

### Mac/Linux/Unix
Using rustup is the recommended way to install rust\
```curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh```\

### Windows
I don't really use Windows, so head over to [rustup](https://rustup.rs).\

Once rust is installed and up to date, clone this repository:
```git clone https://github.com/Dominickator/Kanye-Discord-Bot.git```\

Make sure you are in a terminal pointed at the Github cloned folder, and run:\
```cargo fetch``` to get the dependencies.\
```cargo build```\
```cargo run```
